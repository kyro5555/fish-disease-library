## Overview

### What is Pasteurellosis?
Pasteurellosis is a bacterial disease affecting various fish species in aquaculture, including Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_), lumpsucker (_Cyclopterus lumpus_), and other marine fish. It is caused by bacteria of the family Pasteurellaceae, particularly _Pasteurella skyensis_ and other related species. The disease has emerged as a significant concern in salmon farming in Norway and Scotland, leading to high mortality rates and economic losses. Pasteurellosis in fish was first identified in Norway in 1989 and has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, with approximately 50 diagnosed cases registered annually in farms in south-western Norway from 2020 to 2022 [5](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1236290/full).

## Symptoms of Pasteurellosis

### Common Symptoms

- **Physical Signs:**
    - **Septicemia:** Systemic bacterial infection affecting multiple organs [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jfd.13381)[2](https://eafpbulletin.scholasticahq.com/article/31534-pasteurella-skyensis-in-atlantic-salmon-salmo-salar-l-in-western-norway).
    - **Hemorrhages:** Reddened areas on internal organs [3](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1125&context=usfwspubs).
    - **Exophthalmia:** Bulging or protruding eyes may occur in some cases [3](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1125&context=usfwspubs).

- **Behavioral Changes:**
    - **Lethargy:** Reduced activity and sluggish swimming [2](https://eafpbulletin.scholasticahq.com/article/31534-pasteurella-skyensis-in-atlantic-salmon-salmo-salar-l-in-western-norway).
    - **Loss of Appetite:** Decreased feeding behavior [2](https://eafpbulletin.scholasticahq.com/article/31534-pasteurella-skyensis-in-atlantic-salmon-salmo-salar-l-in-western-norway).
    - **Abnormal Swimming Patterns:** Fish may swim sluggishly and in random patterns [2](https://eafpbulletin.scholasticahq.com/article/31534-pasteurella-skyensis-in-atlantic-salmon-salmo-salar-l-in-western-norway).

**Progression of Symptoms**

- **Early Stages:** Subtle signs such as reduced feed intake and slight lethargy.

- **Advanced Stages:** More pronounced physical symptoms such as septicemia and increased mortality [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jfd.13381)[2](https://eafpbulletin.scholasticahq.com/article/31534-pasteurella-skyensis-in-atlantic-salmon-salmo-salar-l-in-western-norway).

- **Impact on Fish Health:** Pasteurellosis severely compromises overall health and can lead to significant mortality if left untreated [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jfd.13381)[2](https://eafpbulletin.scholasticahq.com/article/31534-pasteurella-skyensis-in-atlantic-salmon-salmo-salar-l-in-western-norway).

### Causes of Pasteurellosis

**Etiology**

- **Causative Agent:** Various Pasteurella species, including _Pasteurella skyensis_ and other related bacteria of the Pasteurellaceae family [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jfd.13381)[2](https://eafpbulletin.scholasticahq.com/article/31534-pasteurella-skyensis-in-atlantic-salmon-salmo-salar-l-in-western-norway)[5](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1236290/full).

- **Transmission Methods:**
    - **Waterborne:** The bacterium can spread through water, especially under conditions of poor water quality [2](https://eafpbulletin.scholasticahq.com/article/31534-pasteurella-skyensis-in-atlantic-salmon-salmo-salar-l-in-western-norway).
    - **Potential transmission between species:** Concerns about transmission between lumpsucker and Atlantic salmon in aquaculture settings [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jfd.13381)[4](https://fishfarmforum.com/study-sheds-new-light-on-pasteurella-infection-in-salmon-and-lumpsuckers/).

**Risk Factors**

- **Environmental Factors:** Stress conditions, such as delousing treatments, can increase susceptibility to Pasteurellosis [2](https://eafpbulletin.scholasticahq.com/article/31534-pasteurella-skyensis-in-atlantic-salmon-salmo-salar-l-in-western-norway).

- **Farm Management Practices:** Use of cleaner fish (e.g., lumpsucker) for delousing may contribute to the spread of the disease [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jfd.13381)[4](https://fishfarmforum.com/study-sheds-new-light-on-pasteurella-infection-in-salmon-and-lumpsuckers/).

### Diagnosis

**Diagnostic Methods**

- **Clinical Examination:** Observation of physical and behavioral symptoms [2](https://eafpbulletin.scholasticahq.com/article/31534-pasteurella-skyensis-in-atlantic-salmon-salmo-salar-l-in-western-norway).

- **Laboratory Tests:**
    - **Bacterial Culture:** Isolation and identification of Pasteurella species from tissue samples [2](https://eafpbulletin.scholasticahq.com/article/31534-pasteurella-skyensis-in-atlantic-salmon-salmo-salar-l-in-western-norway).
    - **MALDI-TOF MS:** Mass spectrometry for rapid identification of bacterial species [2](https://eafpbulletin.scholasticahq.com/article/31534-pasteurella-skyensis-in-atlantic-salmon-salmo-salar-l-in-western-norway).
    - **Whole Genome Sequencing:** For precise identification and discrimination of Pasteurella strains [2](https://eafpbulletin.scholasticahq.com/article/31534-pasteurella-skyensis-in-atlantic-salmon-salmo-salar-l-in-western-norway)[5](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1236290/full).

**Differential Diagnosis**

- **Distinguishing Pasteurellosis from Other Diseases:** It is crucial to differentiate Pasteurellosis from other bacterial diseases with similar symptoms [2](https://eafpbulletin.scholasticahq.com/article/31534-pasteurella-skyensis-in-atlantic-salmon-salmo-salar-l-in-western-norway).

### Treatment and Prevention

**Treatment Options**

- **Current Treatments:**
    - **Antibiotics:** Administered through feed, but may have limited efficacy due to reduced appetite in affected fish [2](https://eafpbulletin.scholasticahq.com/article/31534-pasteurella-skyensis-in-atlantic-salmon-salmo-salar-l-in-western-norway).
    - **Alternative Methods:** Injection of antibiotics may be considered for smaller populations or valuable fish [2](https://eafpbulletin.scholasticahq.com/article/31534-pasteurella-skyensis-in-atlantic-salmon-salmo-salar-l-in-western-norway).


**Preventive Measures**
