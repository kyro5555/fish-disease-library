## Overview

### What are Winter Wounds?
Winter wounds, also known as winter ulcers or winter sores, are a common condition affecting farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), typically occurring during the colder months. These wounds are primarily caused by bacterial infections, particularly Moritella viscosa, and are exacerbated by cold water temperatures, significantly impacting fish health and welfare [1](https://www.fishfarmermagazine.com/2023/08/02/winter-wounds-issue-is-a-concern-says-seafood-norway/)[2](https://thefishsite.com/articles/new-research-could-help-reduce-winter-ulcers-in-farmed-salmon). Winter wounds are prevalent in salmon farming regions with colder climates, such as Norway, Scotland, and Canada. While primarily affecting Atlantic salmon, other salmonid species can also suffer from similar conditions under cold water temperatures.

## Symptoms of Winter Wounds

### Common Symptoms

- **Physical Signs:**
    - **Skin Lesions:** Open sores or ulcers on the skin, often starting on the scales and potentially reaching muscle tissue [2](https://thefishsite.com/articles/new-research-could-help-reduce-winter-ulcers-in-farmed-salmon)[4](https://weareaquaculture.com/news/aquaculture/norwegian-researchers-in-the-battle-against-winter-ulcers-in-salmon).
    - **Inflammation:** Reddened and swollen areas around the wounds.
    - **Superficial to Deep Wounds:** Ranging from superficial wounds to deep ulcers affecting muscle tissue [2](https://thefishsite.com/articles/new-research-could-help-reduce-winter-ulcers-in-farmed-salmon)[4](https://weareaquaculture.com/news/aquaculture/norwegian-researchers-in-the-battle-against-winter-ulcers-in-salmon).

- **Behavioral Changes:**
    - **Reduced Activity:** Fish may show signs of discomfort and reduced mobility due to wounds.

**Progression of Symptoms**

- **Early Stages:** Bacteria attach to the surface of scales, multiplying and forming colonies between the mucous layer and scales [2](https://thefishsite.com/articles/new-research-could-help-reduce-winter-ulcers-in-farmed-salmon)[4](https://weareaquaculture.com/news/aquaculture/norwegian-researchers-in-the-battle-against-winter-ulcers-in-salmon).

- **Advanced Stages:** Wounds become larger and deeper, potentially reaching muscle tissue if left untreated [2](https://thefishsite.com/articles/new-research-could-help-reduce-winter-ulcers-in-farmed-salmon)[4](https://weareaquaculture.com/news/aquaculture/norwegian-researchers-in-the-battle-against-winter-ulcers-in-salmon).

- **Impact on Fish Health:** Winter wounds compromise the fish's skin barrier, making them more susceptible to infections and reducing overall vitality.

### Causes of Winter Wounds

**Etiology**

- **Primary Cause:** Bacterial infection, predominantly by Moritella viscosa [1](https://www.fishfarmermagazine.com/2023/08/02/winter-wounds-issue-is-a-concern-says-seafood-norway/)[2](https://thefishsite.com/articles/new-research-could-help-reduce-winter-ulcers-in-farmed-salmon)[4](https://weareaquaculture.com/news/aquaculture/norwegian-researchers-in-the-battle-against-winter-ulcers-in-salmon).
- **Environmental Factors:** Cold water temperatures (8°C or lower) increase susceptibility to infections [4](https://weareaquaculture.com/news/aquaculture/norwegian-researchers-in-the-battle-against-winter-ulcers-in-salmon).
- **Secondary Infections:** Other opportunistic pathogens can infect open wounds, exacerbating the condition.

**Risk Factors**

- **Environmental Factors:** Cold seawater temperatures, particularly during winter months [1](https://www.fishfarmermagazine.com/2023/08/02/winter-wounds-issue-is-a-concern-says-seafood-norway/)[2](https://thefishsite.com/articles/new-research-could-help-reduce-winter-ulcers-in-farmed-salmon)[4](https://weareaquaculture.com/news/aquaculture/norwegian-researchers-in-the-battle-against-winter-ulcers-in-salmon).
- **Farm Management Practices:** Handling of fish for sea lice treatments may contribute to the problem [1](https://www.fishfarmermagazine.com/2023/08/02/winter-wounds-issue-is-a-concern-says-seafood-norway/).

### Diagnosis

**Diagnostic Methods**

- **Clinical Examination:** Observation of physical symptoms, such as skin lesions and ulcers.

- **Laboratory Tests:**
    - **Bacterial Culture:** Identifying Moritella viscosa and its various strains [2](https://thefishsite.com/articles/new-research-could-help-reduce-winter-ulcers-in-farmed-salmon)[4](https://weareaquaculture.com/news/aquaculture/norwegian-researchers-in-the-battle-against-winter-ulcers-in-salmon).
    - **Histopathology:** Examination of wound tissues to assess the extent of damage and infection.

**Differential Diagnosis**

- **Distinguishing Winter Wounds from Other Conditions:** It is crucial to identify the specific strain of Moritella viscosa for effective treatment and vaccination [2](https://thefishsite.com/articles/new-research-could-help-reduce-winter-ulcers-in-farmed-salmon)[4](https://weareaquaculture.com/news/aquaculture/norwegian-researchers-in-the-battle-against-winter-ulcers-in-salmon).

### Treatment and Prevention

**Treatment Options**

- **Current Treatments:**
    - **Vaccines:** Several vaccines against different Moritella viscosa strains are available, though efficacy varies [2](https://thefishsite.com/articles/new-research-could-help-reduce-winter-ulcers-in-farmed-salmon)[4](https://weareaquaculture.com/news/aquaculture/norwegian-researchers-in-the-battle-against-winter-ulcers-in-salmon).
