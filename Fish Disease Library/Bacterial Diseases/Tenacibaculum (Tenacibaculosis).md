## Overview

### What is Tenacibaculosis?
Tenacibaculosis is a bacterial disease affecting various fish species in aquaculture, including Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_), rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_), and marine species such as sea bass (_Dicentrarchus labrax_) and sea bream (_Sparus aurata_). It is caused by the bacterium _Tenacibaculum maritimum_, leading to skin ulcers, fin erosion, and high mortality rates, resulting in significant economic losses. The disease was first identified in Japan in the 1970s and has since been reported in many countries worldwide, including Norway, Chile, and the United States [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[2](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf)[4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36683696/).

## Symptoms of Tenacibaculosis

### Common Symptoms

- **Physical Signs:**
    - **Skin Ulcers:** Deep, necrotic ulcers on the skin, often around the mouth, fins, and body.
    - **Fin Erosion:** Fraying and degradation of the fins, especially the caudal (tail) fin.
    - **Hemorrhages:** Reddened areas on the skin and fins due to bleeding.
    - **Exophthalmia:** Bulging or protruding eyes.
    - **Necrosis:** Tissue death in severe cases, leading to extensive damage.

- **Behavioral Changes:**
    - **Lethargy:** Reduced activity and slow swimming.
    - **Loss of Appetite:** Decreased feeding behavior and significant weight loss.
    - **Abnormal Swimming Patterns:** Fish may swim erratically or show signs of distress due to pain from ulcers.


**Progression of Symptoms**

- **Early Stages:** Small, localized lesions and mild redness around the mouth and fins.
- **Advanced Stages:** Severe skin ulcers, extensive fin erosion, and high mortality if left untreated.
- **Impact on Fish Health:** Tenacibaculosis severely compromises the skin barrier, leading to stress, reduced growth rates, and higher susceptibility to secondary infections [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[2](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf).

### Causes of Tenacibaculosis

**Etiology**

- **Causative Agent:** _Tenacibaculum maritimum_ bacterium.

- **Transmission Methods:**
    - **Direct Contact:** Spread between infected and healthy fish through close proximity.
    - **Waterborne:** The bacterium can spread through water, especially under conditions of poor water quality and high organic load [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[2](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf)[4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36683696/).


**Risk Factors**

- **Environmental Factors:** Poor water quality, high stocking densities, and stressful conditions can increase susceptibility to Tenacibaculosis.

- **Farm Management Practices:** Ineffective biosecurity measures and lack of routine health monitoring can facilitate the spread of the bacterium [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[2](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf)[4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36683696/).


### Diagnosis

**Diagnostic Methods**

- **Clinical Examination:** Observation of physical symptoms, such as skin ulcers and fin erosion.

- **Laboratory Tests:**
    - **Bacterial Culture:** Isolation and identification of _Tenacibaculum maritimum_ from tissue samples.
    - **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction):** Detects bacterial DNA in tissue samples.
    - **Histopathology:** Microscopic examination of tissue samples to assess the extent of tissue damage and infection [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[2](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf)[4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36683696/).


**Differential Diagnosis**

- **Distinguishing Tenacibaculosis from Other Diseases:** It is crucial to differentiate Tenacibaculosis from other ulcerative conditions, such as vibriosis and Moritella viscosa infections [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[2](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf)[4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36683696/).

### Treatment and Prevention

**Treatment Options**

- **Current Treatments:**
    - **Antibiotics:** Administered through medicated feed or water to treat bacterial infections.
    - **Topical Treatments:** Application of antiseptics or antibacterial agents to affected areas.

- **Supportive Care:**
    - **Improving Water Quality:** Ensuring optimal water conditions to support healing and reduce stress.
    - **Reducing Stocking Densities:** Lowering fish density to minimize the spread of infection [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[2](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf)[4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36683696/).

**Preventive Measures**

- **Biosecurity Protocols:**
    - Implementing strict biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction and spread of _Tenacibaculum maritimum_.
    - Regular monitoring of fish health to detect and address early signs of infection.

- **Farm Management Practices:**
    - Using equipment and facilities designed to minimize skin abrasions and injuries.
    - Ensuring adequate nutrition to support immune function and wound healing.
    - Implementing fallowing periods and site rotations to break the infection cycle [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[2](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf)[4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36683696/).

### Case Studies
