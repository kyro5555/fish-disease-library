## Overview

### What is Bacterial Kidney Disease (BKD)?
Bacterial Kidney Disease (BKD) is a chronic bacterial infection affecting various fish species in aquaculture, including Atlantic salmon (*Salmo salar*), rainbow trout (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*), and other freshwater and marine fish. It is caused by the bacterium *Renibacterium salmoninarum*, leading to significant economic losses due to high mortality rates, reduced growth performance, and increased susceptibility to secondary infections [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/bacterial_kidney_disease.pdf) [2](https://www.glfc.org/pubs/SpecialPubs/sp83_2/pdf/chap21.pdf) [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/veterinary-science-and-veterinary-medicine/bacterial-kidney-disease).

## Symptoms of Bacterial Kidney Disease

## Common Symptoms

- **Physical Signs:**
    - **Swollen Kidney:** Enlarged, pale, and granular kidneys upon internal examination [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/bacterial_kidney_disease.pdf) [2](https://www.glfc.org/pubs/SpecialPubs/sp83_2/pdf/chap21.pdf).
    - **Exophthalmia:** Protruding or bulging eyes [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/bacterial_kidney_disease.pdf) [2](https://www.glfc.org/pubs/SpecialPubs/sp83_2/pdf/chap21.pdf).

    - **Hemorrhages:** Reddened areas on the skin, fins, and internal organs [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/bacterial_kidney_disease.pdf) [2](https://www.glfc.org/pubs/SpecialPubs/sp83_2/pdf/chap21.pdf).
    - **Abdominal Swelling:** Distended abdomen due to fluid accumulation and enlarged organs [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/bacterial_kidney_disease.pdf) [2](https://www.glfc.org/pubs/SpecialPubs/sp83_2/pdf/chap21.pdf).

- **Behavioral Changes:**
    - **Lethargy:** Reduced activity and slow swimming [2](https://www.glfc.org/pubs/SpecialPubs/sp83_2/pdf/chap21.pdf)[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/veterinary-science-and-veterinary-medicine/bacterial-kidney-disease).
    - **Loss of Appetite:** Decreased feeding behavior and significant weight loss [2](https://www.glfc.org/pubs/SpecialPubs/sp83_2/pdf/chap21.pdf)[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/veterinary-science-and-veterinary-medicine/bacterial-kidney-disease).
    - **Abnormal Swimming Patterns:** Fish may swim erratically or in circles due to distress and weakness [2](https://www.glfc.org/pubs/SpecialPubs/sp83_2/pdf/chap21.pdf) [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/veterinary-science-and-veterinary-medicine/bacterial-kidney-disease).

**Progression of Symptoms**

- **Early Stages:** Subtle signs such as reduced feed intake and slight lethargy [2](https://www.glfc.org/pubs/SpecialPubs/sp83_2/pdf/chap21.pdf) [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/veterinary-science-and-veterinary-medicine/bacterial-kidney-disease).

- **Advanced Stages:** Pronounced physical symptoms, including swollen kidneys, skin lesions, and hemorrhages, leading to high mortality if not managed [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/bacterial_kidney_disease.pdf) [2](https://www.glfc.org/pubs/SpecialPubs/sp83_2/pdf/chap21.pdf).

- **Impact on Fish Health:** BKD severely compromises immune function and overall vitality, making fish susceptible to secondary infections and reduced growth rates [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/bacterial_kidney_disease.pdf) [2](https://www.glfc.org/pubs/SpecialPubs/sp83_2/pdf/chap21.pdf).

### Causes of Bacterial Kidney Disease

**Etiology**

- **Causative Agent:** _Renibacterium salmoninarum_ bacterium [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/bacterial_kidney_disease.pdf) [2](https://www.glfc.org/pubs/SpecialPubs/sp83_2/pdf/chap21.pdf).

- **Transmission Methods:**
    - **Direct Contact:** Spread between infected & healthy fish through close proximity [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/bacterial_kidney_disease.pdf) [2](https://www.glfc.org/pubs/SpecialPubs/sp83_2/pdf/chap21.pdf).
    - **Waterborne:** The bacterium can spread through water, especially under conditions of poor water quality and high organic load [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/bacterial_kidney_disease.pdf) [2](https://www.glfc.org/pubs/SpecialPubs/sp83_2/pdf/chap21.pdf).
    - **Vertical Transmission:** Infected broodstock can transmit the bacterium to their offspring through eggs [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/bacterial_kidney_disease.pdf) [2](https://www.glfc.org/pubs/SpecialPubs/sp83_2/pdf/chap21.pdf).


**Risk Factors**

- **Environmental Factors:** Poor water quality, high stocking densities, and stressful conditions can increase susceptibility to BKD [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/bacterial_kidney_disease.pdf) [2](https://www.glfc.org/pubs/SpecialPubs/sp83_2/pdf/chap21.pdf).
- **Farm Management Practices:** Ineffective biosecurity measures and lack of routine health monitoring can facilitate the spread of the bacterium [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/bacterial_kidney_disease.pdf) [2](https://www.glfc.org/pubs/SpecialPubs/sp83_2/pdf/chap21.pdf).

### Diagnosis

**Diagnostic Methods**

- **Clinical Examination:** Observation of physical and behavioral symptoms indicative of BKD.

- **Laboratory Tests:**
    - **Bacterial Culture:** Isolation and identification of _Renibacterium salmoninarum_ from tissue samples. However, R. salmoninarum is slow-growing on bacteriological media, and samples may become overgrown by faster-growing microorganisms, making culture difficult [5](https://food.ec.europa.eu/document/download/e0fa9624-88b7-438a-83a0-294a2622d593_en?filename=sci-com_scah_out36_en.pdf) [7](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/bacterial-kidney-disease-bkd).
    - **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction):** Detects bacterial DNA in tissue samples [5](https://food.ec.europa.eu/document/download/e0fa9624-88b7-438a-83a0-294a2622d593_en?filename=sci-com_scah_out36_en.pdf) [7](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/bacterial-kidney-disease-bkd).
    - **Histopathology:** Microscopic examination of kidney and other tissues to assess the extent of damage and infection [7](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/bacterial-kidney-disease-bkd).
    - **Fluorescent Antibody Test (FAT):** Used for confirmatory identification [5](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/bacterial-kidney-disease-bkd).
    - **Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA):** Quantifies the level of soluble antigen (p57) in kidney tissue [4](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2004/59/d059p125.pdf) [8](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/bacterial-kidney-disease-bkd).

**Differential Diagnosis**

- **Distinguishing BKD from Other Diseases:** It is crucial to differentiate BKD from diseases with similar symptoms, such as Infectious Hematopoietic Necrosis (IHN) and other bacterial infections [8](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/bacterial-kidney-disease-bkd).

### Treatment and Prevention

**Treatment Options**

- **Current Treatments:**
    - **Antibiotics:** Erythromycin and sulfamethazine can control the disease while administered, but mortality often resumes when treatment is withdrawn [2](https://www.glfc.org/pubs/SpecialPubs/sp83_2/pdf/chap21.pdf).
    - **Supportive Care:** Improving water quality and reducing stress to support recovery.

- **Experimental Treatments:** Research is ongoing into potential vaccines and alternative treatment methods.

**Preventive Measures**

- **Biosecurity Protocols:**
    - Implementing strict biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction and spread of _Renibacterium salmoninarum [5](https://food.ec.europa.eu/document/download/e0fa9624-88b7-438a-83a0-294a2622d593_en?filename=sci-com_scah_out36_en.pdf).
    - Regular disinfection of equipment and facilities to minimize the risk of contamination [6](https://food.ec.europa.eu/document/download/e0fa9624-88b7-438a-83a0-294a2622d593_en?filename=sci-com_scah_out36_en.pdf).

- **Farm Management Practices:**
    - Reducing stocking densities to decrease the risk of bacterial transmission [4](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2004/59/d059p125.pdf).
    - Using water treatment systems to maintain optimal water quality [4](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2004/59/d059p125.pdf).
    - Regular health monitoring and early detection programs to identify and manage outbreaks promptly [5](https://food.ec.europa.eu/document/download/e0fa9624-88b7-438a-83a0-294a2622d593_en?filename=sci-com_scah_out36_en.pdf).
    - Culling of infected broodstock and/or total hatchery depopulation followed by disinfection [5](https://food.ec.europa.eu/document/download/e0fa9624-88b7-438a-83a0-294a2622d593_en?filename=sci-com_scah_out36_en.pdf).

### Case Studies

**Real-World Examples**

- **Notable Outbreaks:**
    - **Scotland (1933):** First reported in wild Atlantic salmon populations in the rivers Spey and Dee [8](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/bacterial-kidney-disease-bkd).
    - **Japan (1970s):** BKD is believed to have been introduced with imports of Coho salmon eggs certified as infection-free [5](https://food.ec.europa.eu/document/download/e0fa9624-88b7-438a-83a0-294a2622d593_en?filename=sci-com_scah_out36_en.pdf).

- **Response Strategies and Outcomes:**
    - **Scotland:** In 1997, when BKD was first diagnosed in a rainbow trout farm, the infected farm and a downstream farm were emptied, cleaned, disinfected, and restocked after a 60-day fallowing period. However, the disease reappeared the following year [5](https://food.ec.europa.eu/document/download/e0fa9624-88b7-438a-83a0-294a2622d593_en?filename=sci-com_scah_out36_en.pdf).

- **Lessons Learned:** The importance of early detection, robust biosecurity, and coordinated response efforts in controlling BKD outbreaks.

## Data Insights

### Disease Impact by Country

#### Scotland

- **BKD Incidence in Scotland:**
    - The prevalence of BKD in trout and salmon farms is low [7](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/bacterial-kidney-disease-bkd).
    - Between 1990 and 2002, BKD was not recorded in wild salmonids from Scotland, with the last recorded case in wild fish occurring in the 1960s [4](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2004/59/d059p125.pdf).

- **Treatment Regimes:**
    - All fish farms holding salmon or trout are inspected at least once a year for BKD [7](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/bacterial-kidney-disease-bkd).
    - Farms confirmed as infected with BKD are controlled by movement restrictions and must enter into an eradication program [7](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/bacterial-kidney-disease-bkd).
