## Overview

### What is Nephocalcinosis?
Nephrocalcinosis is a non-infectious condition affecting various fish species in aquaculture, including Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_), rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_), and other salmonids. It is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of calcium deposits in the kidneys, leading to impaired kidney function and overall health [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10157097/)[2](https://nofima.com/results/diagnosing-nephrocalcinosis-in-the-field/). Nephrocalcinosis is often associated with poor water quality, especially high levels of carbon dioxide and alkalinity, as well as dietary imbalances [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13815).

## Symptoms of Nephrocalcinosis

## Common Symptoms

- **Physical Signs:**
    - **Enlarged Kidneys:** Noticeably swollen kidneys upon internal examination [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10157097/).
    - **Calcium Deposits:** Visible white calcium deposits in the kidneys, detectable upon dissection [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10157097/).
    - **Abdominal Swelling:** Distended abdomen due to fluid accumulation and enlarged kidneys [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10157097/).
    - **Pale Gills:** Indicative of anemia and reduced kidney function [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10157097/).

- **Behavioral Changes:**
    - **Lethargy:** Reduced activity and slower swimming movements [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10157097/).
    - **Loss of Appetite:** Decreased feeding behavior and subsequent weight loss [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10157097/).
    - **Abnormal Swimming Patterns:** Fish may exhibit erratic or sluggish swimming due to discomfort [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10157097/).


**Progression of Symptoms**

- **Early Stages:** Subtle signs such as reduced feed intake and slight lethargy [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10157097/).

- **Advanced Stages:** Pronounced physical symptoms, including enlarged kidneys, calcium deposits, and increased mortality if not managed [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10157097/).

- **Impact on Fish Health:** Nephrocalcinosis severely compromises kidney function, leading to impaired waste excretion, stress, and reduced growth rates [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10157097/)[3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13815).

## Causes of Nephrocalcinosis

**Etiology**

- **Non-infectious Condition:** Nephrocalcinosis is not caused by a pathogen but by environmental and dietary factors [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10157097/)[2](https://nofima.com/results/diagnosing-nephrocalcinosis-in-the-field/).

- **Contributing Factors:**
    - **High Carbon Dioxide Levels:** Elevated CO2 in the water can lead to metabolic imbalances and calcium precipitation in the kidneys [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13815).
    - **Water Alkalinity:** High alkalinity levels contribute to the formation of calcium deposits [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13815).
    - **Dietary Imbalances:** Excessive calcium or phosphorus in the diet can exacerbate the condition [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13815).


**Risk Factors**

- **Environmental Factors:** Poor water quality, especially high CO2 levels and alkalinity, can increase susceptibility to nephrocalcinosis [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13815).

- **Dietary Factors:** Imbalanced diets with high calcium or phosphorus content can lead to the development of the condition [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13815).

## Diagnosis

**Diagnostic Methods**

- **Clinical Examination:** Observation of physical symptoms such as abdominal swelling and pale gills [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10157097/).
- **Laboratory Tests:**
    
    - **Histopathology:** Microscopic examination of kidney tissues to identify calcium deposits and assess the extent of damage [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10157097/).
    - **X-ray or Imaging:** Imaging techniques to visualize calcium deposits in the kidneys [3](https://nofima.com/results/diagnosing-nephrocalcinosis-in-the-field/).
    - **Water Quality Testing:** Assessing water parameters such as CO2 levels, alkalinity, and calcium content [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13815).
    

**Differential Diagnosis**

- **Distinguishing Nephrocalcinosis from Other Conditions:** It is crucial to differentiate nephrocalcinosis from other kidney-related diseases and conditions that may present similar symptoms, such as bacterial kidney disease (BKD) and other metabolic disorders[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10157097/).

## Treatment and Prevention

**Treatment Options**

- **Current Treatments:**
    - **Water Quality Management:** Reducing CO2 levels and alkalinity in the water through improved aeration and water treatment systems [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13815).
    - **Dietary Adjustments:** Balancing dietary calcium and phosphorus levels to prevent excessive accumulation in the kidneys [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13815).

- **Supportive Care:**
    - **Monitoring Health:** Regular monitoring of fish health and kidney function to detect and manage early signs of nephrocalcinosis [2](https://nofima.com/results/diagnosing-nephrocalcinosis-in-the-field/).


**Preventive Measures**

- **Biosecurity Protocols:**
    - Implementing strict water quality management practices to maintain optimal conditions and prevent nephrocalcinosis [2](https://nofima.com/results/diagnosing-nephrocalcinosis-in-the-field/)[3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13815).
    - Regular monitoring of water parameters and fish health to detect early signs of imbalances [2](https://nofima.com/results/diagnosing-nephrocalcinosis-in-the-field/).

- **Farm Management Practices:**
    - Adjusting feeding regimes to ensure balanced nutrition and prevent dietary imbalances [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13815).
    - Implementing fallowing periods and site rotations to maintain water quality and reduce stress on fish populations [2](https://nofima.com/results/diagnosing-nephrocalcinosis-in-the-field/).

## Case Studies

**Real-World Examples**

- **Notable Outbreaks:**
    - **Norway (2010 - 2020s):** Nephrocalcinosis has been increasingly observed in Norwegian salmon farming, particularly in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). The issue has been linked to suboptimal water quality, especially elevated levels of carbon dioxide (CO2). Research conducted by the Norwegian Veterinary Institute identified a significant rise in cases of nephrocalcinosis, prompting the industry to implement stricter monitoring and management practices to control CO2 levels and improve water quality.
