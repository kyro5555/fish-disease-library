## Overview

### What is Gas Bubble Disease (GBD)?
Gas Bubble Disease (GBD), or Gas Bubble Trauma, is a non-infectious condition that affects various fish species in aquaculture, including Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_), rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_), and other freshwater and marine fish. It is caused by supersaturation of water with gases such as nitrogen or oxygen, leading to the formation of gas bubbles in the blood and tissues of fish [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/gas_bubble_disease.pdf) [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9289892/). GBD can result in significant economic losses due to high mortality rates and impaired fish health. The disease can manifest in a chronic form at around 103% total gas pressure (TGP) and in an acute form when TGP exceeds 110-115% [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9289892/).

## Symptoms of Gas Bubble Disease

### Common Symptoms

- **Physical Signs:**
    - **Gas Bubbles:** Visible gas bubbles under the skin, in the eyes, gills, fins, and other tissues [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/gas_bubble_disease.pdf).
    - **Exophthalmia:** Protruding or bulging eyes due to gas bubbles [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/gas_bubble_disease.pdf).
    - **Hemorrhages:** Reddened areas on the skin, fins, and internal organs due to ruptured blood vessels [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/gas_bubble_disease.pdf).
    - **Abdominal Distension:** Swollen abdomen due to gas accumulation in internal organs [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/gas_bubble_disease.pdf).

- **Behavioral Changes:**
    - **Lethargy:** Reduced activity and slow swimming [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/gas_bubble_disease.pdf).
    - **Loss of Appetite:** Decreased feeding behavior and significant weight loss [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/gas_bubble_disease.pdf).
    - **Abnormal Swimming Patterns:** Erratic or sluggish swimming due to discomfort and distress from gas bubbles [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/gas_bubble_disease.pdf).

**Progression of Symptoms**

- **Early Stages:** Subtle signs such as reduced feed intake and slight lethargy [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9289892/).

- **Advanced Stages:** Pronounced physical symptoms including visible gas bubbles, exophthalmia, and hemorrhages, leading to high mortality if not managed [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/gas_bubble_disease.pdf) [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9289892/).

- **Impact on Fish Health:** GBD severely compromises the ability of fish to function normally, leading to stress, reduced growth rates, and higher susceptibility to secondary infections [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/gas_bubble_disease.pdf)[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9289892/).

### Causes of Gas Bubble Disease

**Etiology**

- **Non-infectious Condition:** GBD is not caused by a pathogen but by environmental factors [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/gas_bubble_disease.pdf)[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9289892/).

- **Contributing Factors:**
    - **Supersaturated Water:** High levels of dissolved gases (nitrogen, oxygen) in water due to factors such as high water temperature, rapid pressure changes, or malfunctioning water aeration systems [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/gas_bubble_disease.pdf)[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848610002875)[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9289892/).

**Risk Factors**

- **Environmental Factors:** Poor water quality, especially high levels of dissolved gases, can increase susceptibility to GBD [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/gas_bubble_disease.pdf) [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9289892/).

- **Farm Management Practices:** Ineffective water management and lack of routine monitoring can facilitate the occurrence of GBD [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/gas_bubble_disease.pdf)[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848610002875).

### Diagnosis

**Diagnostic Methods**

- **Clinical Examination:** Observation of physical symptoms such as gas bubbles under the skin and in the eyes [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/gas_bubble_disease.pdf).

- **Laboratory Tests:**
    - **Gas Analysis:** Measurement of dissolved gas levels in water to confirm supersaturation [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/gas_bubble_disease.pdf)[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9289892/).
    - **Histopathology:** Microscopic examination of tissues to assess the extent of gas bubble formation and associated damage [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/gas_bubble_disease.pdf).

**Differential Diagnosis**

- **Distinguishing GBD from Other Conditions:** It is crucial to differentiate GBD from other conditions with similar symptoms, such as bacterial infections that cause hemorrhages and other physical abnormalities [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/gas_bubble_disease.pdf)[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9289892/).

### Treatment and Prevention

**Treatment Options**

- **Current Treatments:** There are no specific medical treatments for GBD. Management focuses on correcting the environmental factors causing gas supersaturation [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/gas_bubble_disease.pdf)[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9289892/).
    - **Water Aeration:** Adjusting water aeration systems to reduce dissolved gas levels [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/gas_bubble_disease.pdf)[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9289892/).
    - **Water Flow Management:** Increasing water flow to reduce gas accumulation [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/gas_bubble_disease.pdf)[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9289892/).

- **Supportive Care:**
    - **Monitoring Health:** Regular monitoring of fish health and water quality to detect and manage early signs of GBD [1](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/disease/pdfs/fishdiseases/gas_bubble_disease.pdf)[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9289892/).


**Preventive Measures**

- **Biosecurity Protocols:**

- **Notable Outbreaks:**
    
    - **United States (2024):** Recent outbreak in the Klamath River resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands of newly hatched Chinook salmon due to GBD caused by extreme changes in water pressure during a dam removal project [4](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/05/salmon-klamath-river-dam-removal-project)[5](https://wildlife.ca.gov/News/Archive/fall-run-chinook-salmon-fry-succumb-to-gas-bubble-disease-in-klamath-river).

## Data Insights

### Disease Impact by Country

#### Norway

- **Gas Bubble Disease Incidence in Norway:**
    
    - The earliest documented incidences of Gas Bubble Disease (GBD) or gas bubble trauma in Norway are associated with hydropower activities, particularly in the late 1980s. These events were linked to gas supersaturation in rivers downstream of hydroelectric installations, which affected Atlantic salmon populations, such as the decline observed in the Vosso watercourse. This suggests that GBD was recognized in Norway at least as early as the 1980s in connection with hydropower operations impacting aquatic life [10](https://bora.uib.no/bora-xmlui/bitstream/handle/1956/15374/150429765.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y).
    
- **Economic Impact:**
    
    - The economic impact of Gas Bubble Disease (GBD) in Norway is not well-documented in specific terms. However, the disease can have significant localized effects on aquaculture, particularly in areas affected by gas supersaturation due to hydropower operations. Losses may include reduced fish survival rates, decreased growth, and increased mortality, which can result in financial losses for fish farms. The costs associated with mitigating GBD, such as improving water management and aeration systems, can also add to the economic burden.
