## Overview

### What is Amoebic Gill Disease (AGD)?
Amoebic Gill Disease (AGD) is a parasitic disease affecting various fish species in aquaculture, including Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_), rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_), and other marine fish. It is caused by the amoeba _Neoparamoeba perurans_, leading to gill inflammation and impaired respiratory function [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/amoebic-gill-disease-agd) [4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebic_gill_disease). AGD was first identified in Tasmania in the 1980s and has since been reported in several other countries, including Norway, Scotland, Ireland, and Chile [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/amoebic-gill-disease-agd) [2](https://www.fishfarmingexpert.com/amoebic-gill-disease/1147466) [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/veterinary-science-and-veterinary-medicine/amoebic-gill-disease).

## Symptoms of Amoebic Gill Disease

### Common Symptoms

- **Physical Signs:**
    - **Gill Lesions:** White mucoid patches and hyperplasia on the gill filaments [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/amoebic-gill-disease-agd) [5](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-6772/2/4/23).
    - **Gill Inflammation:** Swollen, reddened, and thickened gill tissues [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/amoebic-gill-disease-agd).
    - **Increased Mucus Production:** Excessive mucus covering the gills [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/amoebic-gill-disease-agd) [5](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-6772/2/4/23).
    - **Respiratory Distress:** Rapid or labored breathing due to impaired gill function [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/amoebic-gill-disease-agd) [2](https://www.fishfarmingexpert.com/amoebic-gill-disease/1147466).

- **Behavioral Changes:**
    - **Lethargy:** Reduced activity and slow swimming [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/amoebic-gill-disease-agd) [2](https://www.fishfarmingexpert.com/amoebic-gill-disease/1147466).
    - **Loss of Appetite:** Decreased feeding behavior and subsequent weight loss [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/amoebic-gill-disease-agd).
    - **Abnormal Swimming Patterns:** Fish may swim near the surface or close to aeration points to compensate for reduced oxygen uptake [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/amoebic-gill-disease-agd) [2](https://www.fishfarmingexpert.com/amoebic-gill-disease/1147466).

**Progression of Symptoms**

- **Early Stages:** Mild gill lesions and slight increase in mucus production [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/amoebic-gill-disease-agd).

- **Advanced Stages:** Severe gill inflammation, extensive mucus production, respiratory distress, and increased mortality if not treated [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/amoebic-gill-disease-agd) [2](https://www.fishfarmingexpert.com/amoebic-gill-disease/1147466).

- **Impact on Fish Health:** AGD severely compromises gill function, leading to stress, reduced growth rates, and higher susceptibility to secondary infections [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/amoebic-gill-disease-agd) [2](https://www.fishfarmingexpert.com/amoebic-gill-disease/1147466) [4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebic_gill_disease).

### Causes of Amoebic Gill Disease

**Etiology**

- **Causative Agent:** The amoeba _Neoparamoeba perurans_ [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/amoebic-gill-disease-agd) [2](https://www.fishfarmingexpert.com/amoebic-gill-disease/1147466) [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/veterinary-science-and-veterinary-medicine/amoebic-gill-disease) [4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebic_gill_disease).

- **Transmission Methods:**
    - **Direct Contact:** Spread between infected and healthy fish through close proximity [2](https://www.fishfarmingexpert.com/amoebic-gill-disease/1147466).
    - **Waterborne:** Amoeba can spread through water, especially under conditions of high organic matter and poor water quality [2](https://www.fishfarmingexpert.com/amoebic-gill-disease/1147466).

**Risk Factors**

- **Environmental Factors:** High water temperatures (above 16°C), high salinity levels, and organic matter can increase susceptibility to AGD [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/amoebic-gill-disease-agd) [2](https://www.fishfarmingexpert.com/amoebic-gill-disease/1147466) [4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebic_gill_disease).

- **Farm Management Practices:** High stocking densities and poor biosecurity measures can facilitate the spread of the amoeba [2](https://www.fishfarmingexpert.com/amoebic-gill-disease/1147466).

### Diagnosis

**Diagnostic Methods**

- **Clinical Examination:** Observation of physical symptoms, such as gill lesions and increased mucus production [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/amoebic-gill-disease-agd) [2](https://www.fishfarmingexpert.com/amoebic-gill-disease/1147466) [5](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-6772/2/4/23).

- **Laboratory Tests:**
    - **Histopathology:** Microscopic examination of gill tissues to identify characteristic lesions of AGD and the presence of amoeba [2](https://www.fishfarmingexpert.com/amoebic-gill-disease/1147466) [4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebic_gill_disease).
    - **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction):** Detects _Neoparamoeba perurans_ genetic material in gill tissues [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/veterinary-science-and-veterinary-medicine/amoebic-gill-disease).
    - **Gill Smears:** Examination of gill smears under a microscope to identify amoebic cells [2](https://www.fishfarmingexpert.com/amoebic-gill-disease/1147466) [4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebic_gill_disease).

**Differential Diagnosis**

- **Distinguishing AGD from Other Gill Diseases:** It is crucial to differentiate AGD from other gill diseases, such as bacterial gill disease (BGD) and parasitic infections (e.g., Ichthyobodo necator). [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/veterinary-science-and-veterinary-medicine/amoebic-gill-disease)

### Treatment and Prevention

**Treatment Options**

- **Current Treatments:**
    - **Freshwater Baths:** Immersion of fish in freshwater for 2 to 3 hours to reduce amoeba load on the gills [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/amoebic-gill-disease-agd) [2](https://www.fishfarmingexpert.com/amoebic-gill-disease/1147466) [4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebic_gill_disease).
    - **Hydrogen Peroxide Baths:** Use of hydrogen peroxide to treat affected fish [13](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/are.13627).
    - **Other Treatments:** Chloramine, chlorine dioxide, and levamisole have also been used [4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebic_gill_disease)

- **Experimental Treatments:** Research is ongoing into potential chemotherapeutants and novel treatment methods, including immunosupportive-based feeds, mucolytic compounds, and parasiticides [4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebic_gill_disease).

**Preventive Measures**

- **Biosecurity Protocols:**
    - Implementing strict biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction and spread of _Neoparamoeba perurans_ [2](https://www.fishfarmingexpert.com/amoebic-gill-disease/1147466).
