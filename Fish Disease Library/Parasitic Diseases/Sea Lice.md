## Overview

### What are Sea Lice?
Sea lice are parasitic copepods that infest farmed and wild fish, notably Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), causing significant health issues and economic losses in the aquaculture industry. The most common species affecting these fish are Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus elongatus [1](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/the-problem-of-sea-lice-in-salmon-farms.html)[2](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&articles_id=388). Sea lice attach to the skin, fins, and gills of fish, feeding on their mucus, skin, and blood, leading to lesions, stress, and secondary infections [4](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/sea-lice). In addition to salmon and trout, sea lice infestations can affect other species such as pink and chum salmon, which are particularly vulnerable due to their lack of scales [2](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&articles_id=388).

## Symptoms of Sea Lice Infestation

### Common Symptoms

- **Physical Signs:**
    - **Skin Lesions:** Visible wounds and ulcerations on the skin, fins, and gills caused by lice attachment and feeding [1](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/the-problem-of-sea-lice-in-salmon-farms.html)[4](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/sea-lice).
    - **Scale Loss:** Areas of scale loss where lice have been feeding.
    - **Inflammation:** Reddened and swollen areas around the attachment sites.
    - **Secondary Infections:** Bacterial and fungal infections can develop at the sites of lice damage [3](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/03/sea-lice-outbreak-icelandic-salmon-farm-welfare-disaster-footage-shows).

- **Behavioral Changes:**
    - **Lethargy:** Reduced activity and swimming stamina due to stress and damage.
    - **Loss of Appetite:** Decreased feeding behavior and subsequent weight loss [1](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/the-problem-of-sea-lice-in-salmon-farms.html).
    - **Abnormal Swimming Patterns:** Fish may exhibit rubbing or flashing behavior, where they scrape against surfaces to remove lice.

**Progression of Symptoms**

- **Early Stages:** Mild skin irritation and small, localized lesions.

- **Advanced Stages:** Severe skin damage, extensive lesions, secondary infections, and increased mortality if not managed [1](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/the-problem-of-sea-lice-in-salmon-farms.html)[3](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/03/sea-lice-outbreak-icelandic-salmon-farm-welfare-disaster-footage-shows).

- **Impact on Fish Health:** Sea lice infestations compromise the skin barrier, leading to stress, reduced growth rates, and higher susceptibility to diseases [2](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&articles_id=388)[4](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/sea-lice).

### Causes of Sea Lice Infestation

**Etiology**

- **Causative Agents:** Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus elongatus [1](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/the-problem-of-sea-lice-in-salmon-farms.html)[2](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&articles_id=388).

- **Transmission Methods:**
    - **Direct Contact:** Spread between infested and healthy fish through close proximity.
    - **Waterborne:** Larval stages of sea lice can disperse through water currents, spreading infestations across farms and to wild populations [1](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/the-problem-of-sea-lice-in-salmon-farms.html)[2](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&articles_id=388).


**Risk Factors**

- **Environmental Factors:** High water temperatures and salinity levels can increase the proliferation and transmission of sea lice [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3675643/).

- **Farm Management Practices:** High stocking densities in salmon farms provide ideal conditions for sea lice reproduction and transmission [1](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/the-problem-of-sea-lice-in-salmon-farms.html)[2](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&articles_id=388).


### Diagnosis

**Diagnostic Methods**

- **Clinical Examination:** Observation of physical symptoms, such as skin lesions and visible lice on the fish [4](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/sea-lice).

- **Laboratory Tests:**
    - **Microscopic Examination:** Identification and counting of lice on sampled fish [4](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/sea-lice).
    - **Histopathology:** Microscopic examination of skin and gill tissues to assess the extent of damage and secondary infections.

**Differential Diagnosis**

- **Distinguishing Sea Lice from Other Conditions:** It is crucial to differentiate sea lice infestations from other skin conditions, such as fungal infections and parasitic infestations.
### Treatment and Prevention

**Treatment Options**

- **Current Treatments:**
    - **Chemical Treatments:** Use of chemotherapeutants such as emamectin benzoate (Slice) and hydrogen peroxide to kill lice [2](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&articles_id=388)[4](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/sea-lice).
    - **Mechanical Removal:** Technologies such as underwater, roofed spaces and snorkel-like tubes to reduce lice exposure [1](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/the-problem-of-sea-lice-in-salmon-farms.html).
    - **Biological Control:** Introduction of cleaner fish, such as wrasse and lumpfish, that feed on sea lice [4](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/sea-lice).

- **Experimental Treatments:** Research into novel treatment methods, such as vaccines, is ongoing but with limited success so far [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3675643/).

**Preventive Measures**

- **Biosecurity Protocols:**
    - Implementing strict biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction and spread of sea lice.
    - Regular monitoring of lice levels and fish health to detect and address early signs of infestation [4](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/sea-lice).

- **Farm Management Practices:**
    - Reducing stocking densities to decrease the risk of lice transmission [1](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/the-problem-of-sea-lice-in-salmon-farms.html).
    - Rotating and fallowing farm sites to break the life cycle of sea lice [4](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/sea-lice).
    - Implementing integrated pest management strategies that combine chemical, mechanical, and biological control methods [1](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/the-problem-of-sea-lice-in-salmon-farms.html)[4](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/sea-lice).

- **Economic Impact:**
    - The economic impact includes treatment costs, reduced appetite, loss in biomass, and shortfall in production.
    - The new traffic light system designations for 2024 could potentially provide 21,000 metric tons of growth in green zones [12](https://www.intrafish.com/salmon/norways-new-traffic-light-system-could-provide-21-000-metric-tons-of-growth/2-1-1608570?zephr_sso_ott=lwkxiH).

- **Treatment & Management:**
    -  Norway implements a unique "[traffic light system](https://blog.manolinaqua.com/en/norway-sea-lice-traffic-light-2024)" to regulate Atlantic salmon production along its coast, aiming for predictable and sustainable growth in the aquaculture industry [14](https://www.salmonbusiness.com/how-does-norways-traffic-light-system-for-salmon-farming-work/).
    - The system categorizes the Norwegian coastline into thirteen production zones, managed based on environmental indicators, primarily sea lice infestation levels [14](https://www.salmonbusiness.com/how-does-norways-traffic-light-system-for-salmon-farming-work/).
    - Each zone is assigned one of three colors – green, yellow, or red – which determine production regulations [14](https://www.salmonbusiness.com/how-does-norways-traffic-light-system-for-salmon-farming-work/):
        
        - Green: Farmers permitted to expand production due to minimal impact on wild salmon from sea lice.
        - Yellow: Production levels maintained, indicating moderate impact on wild salmon.
        - Red: Production reductions due to high sea lice levels adversely affecting wild salmon.
        
    - Combination of preventative methods, mechanical treatments, use of cleaner fish, and exploration of new treatments such as functional feeds and potentially vaccination.
    - The government employs various sampling methods to evaluate sea lice impact, including bait & net sampling, salmon trawling, and strategically placed cages [11](https://blog.manolinaqua.com/en/norway-sea-lice-traffic-light-2024).

- **Recent Developments:**
    - In 2024, six out of thirteen production areas were given a green light for increased production, five were yellow maintaining current levels, and two were red, where production will be reduced [13](https://hatcheryfm.com/fish/norway-sets-new-aquaculture-traffic-lights/)[14](https://www.salmonbusiness.com/how-does-norways-traffic-light-system-for-salmon-farming-work/).
    - The overall female sea lice pressure across Norway's production areas did not surpass the 100 million threshold for the first time in six years (2019 - 2024) [11](https://blog.manolinaqua.com/en/norway-sea-lice-traffic-light-2024).
    - However, a new report by Dr. Martin Jaffa challenges the efficacy of the Traffic Light System, asserting that it has failed to show any benefits for wild salmon and is flawed in its scientific basis [10](https://www.salmonbusiness.com/new-report-tears-into-norways-traffic-light-system-for-lice-control-finds-no-benefits-for-wild-fish/).
