## Overview

### What is Proliferative Gill Disease (PGD)?
Proliferative Gill Disease (PGD) is an emerging problem in salmonid aquaculture, particularly affecting Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in both freshwater and marine environments [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18521535/)[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/raq.12426). It is characterized by proliferative changes in gill tissue and can be associated with various pathogens, including parasites, bacteria, and viruses [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18521535/)[2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426). PGD leads to significant economic losses due to high mortality rates, impaired respiratory function, and reduced growth performance in farmed salmon [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426)[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/raq.12426).

## Symptoms of Proliferative Gill Disease

## Common Symptoms

- **Physical Signs:**
    - **Gill Proliferation:** Thickened, swollen, and pale gills with excessive mucus production [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426)[4](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/9/12/2605).
    - **Gill Lesions:** White or greyish nodules and lesions on the gills [4](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/9/12/2605).
    - **Hemorrhages:** Reddened areas in the gill tissues due to bleeding [4](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/9/12/2605).
    - **Respiratory Distress:** Rapid or labored breathing due to impaired gill function [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426).

- **Behavioral Changes:**
    - **Lethargy:** Reduced activity and slow swimming [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426).
    - **Loss of Appetite:** Decreased feeding behavior and significant weight loss [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426).
    - **Abnormal Swimming Patterns:** Fish may swim near the surface or close to aeration points to compensate for reduced oxygen uptake [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426).

**Progression of Symptoms**

- **Early Stages:** Mild signs such as reduced feed intake and slight lethargy [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426).

- **Advanced Stages:** Pronounced physical symptoms including gill proliferation, lesions, and respiratory distress, leading to high mortality if not managed [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426)[4](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/9/12/2605).

- **Impact on Fish Health:** PGD severely compromises respiratory function, leading to stress, reduced growth rates, and higher susceptibility to secondary infections [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426)[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/raq.12426).

## Causes of Proliferative Gill Disease

**Etiology**

- **Causative Agents:** Multiple pathogens can be associated with PGD in salmonids, including:
    - **Parasites:** Ichthyobodo spp., Neoparamoeba sp. [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18521535/)[2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426)
    - **Bacteria:** Flexibacter/Flavobacterium, 'Candidatus Branchiomonas cysticola' [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18521535/)[2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426)
    - **Viruses:** Salmon gill poxvirus (SGPV) [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18521535/)[3](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Salmo-salar-L-Atlantic-salmon-with-proliferative-gill-inflammation-PGI-Haemalum-and_fig2_7385165)

- **Transmission Methods:**
    - **Waterborne:** Pathogens spread through water, particularly in conditions of high fish density and poor water quality [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426).
    - **Direct Contact:** Spread between infected and healthy fish through close proximity [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426).

**Risk Factors**

- **Environmental Factors:** Poor water quality, high stocking densities, and stress conditions can increase susceptibility to PGD [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426)[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/raq.12426).

- **Farm Management Practices:** Ineffective biosecurity measures and lack of routine health monitoring can facilitate the spread of pathogens [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426)[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/raq.12426).

## Diagnosis

**Diagnostic Methods**

- **Clinical Examination:** Observation of physical and behavioral symptoms indicative of PGD [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426)[4](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/9/12/2605).

- **Laboratory Tests:**
    - **Histopathology:** Microscopic examination of gill tissues to identify characteristic lesions and pathogens [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18521535/)[4](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/9/12/2605).
    - **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction):** Detects specific pathogens associated with PGD, such as SGPV [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18521535/)[3](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Salmo-salar-L-Atlantic-salmon-with-proliferative-gill-inflammation-PGI-Haemalum-and_fig2_7385165).
    - **Gross Pathological Scoring:** A novel total gill scoring system has been developed to assess gross pathological changes [4](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/9/12/2605).

**Differential Diagnosis**

- **Distinguishing PGD from Other Gill Diseases:** It is crucial to differentiate PGD from other gill diseases, such as amoebic gill disease (AGD) and complex gill disease (CGD) [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426)[4](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/9/12/2605)[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/raq.12426).

## Treatment and Prevention

**Treatment Options**

- **Current Treatments:** There are no specific treatments for PGD. Management focuses on preventing the spread and mitigating the impact through biosecurity measures and supportive care [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426)[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/raq.12426).
- **Experimental Treatments:** Research is ongoing into potential antiparasitic agents and other therapeutic approaches [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426).

**Preventive Measures**

- **Biosecurity Protocols:**
    - Implementing strict quarantine measures for new stock to prevent the introduction of pathogens [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426)[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/raq.12426).
    - Regular disinfection of equipment and facilities to minimize the risk of contamination [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426)[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/raq.12426).

- **Farm Management Practices:**
    - Reducing stocking densities to decrease the risk of pathogen transmission [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426)[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/raq.12426).
    - Regular health monitoring and early detection programs to identify and manage outbreaks promptly [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426)[4](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/9/12/2605)[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/raq.12426).
    - Implementing all-in/all-out stocking practices to reduce the risk of spreading infections [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12426)[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/raq.12426).
