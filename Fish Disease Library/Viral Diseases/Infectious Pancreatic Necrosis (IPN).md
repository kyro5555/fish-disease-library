## Overview

### What is Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis (IPN)?
Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis (IPN) is a highly contagious viral disease affecting various fish species in aquaculture, including Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_), rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_), and other salmonids. It is caused by the Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus (IPNV), a member of the Birnaviridae family, leading to high mortality rates, especially in young fish, and significant economic losses [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis-ipn)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_pancreatic_necrosis). IPN primarily affects juvenile salmonids, particularly in the fry and post-smolt stages, but can also infect adult fish asymptomatically [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis-ipn).

## Symptoms of Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis

### Common Symptoms

- **Physical Signs:**
    - **Abdominal Swelling:** Distended abdomen due to fluid accumulation [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis-ipn)[4](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis.pdf).
    - **Pale Gills:** Typically pale gills in affected fish [4](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis.pdf).
    - **Hemorrhages:** Bleeding in internal organs, including ventral areas and fins [4](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis.pdf).
    - **Darkening of the Skin:** Affected fish may exhibit darkened coloration [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis-ipn)[4](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis.pdf).
- **Behavioral Changes:**
    - **Lethargy:** Fish lying still on the bottom of tanks or ponds [4](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis.pdf).
    - **Loss of Appetite:** Anorexia and significant weight loss [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_pancreatic_necrosis).
    - **Abnormal Swimming Patterns:** Fish may swim in a corkscrew or spiral motion [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis-ipn)[4](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis.pdf).


**Progression of Symptoms**

- **Early Stages:** Sudden and progressive increase in mortality at first feeding of fry, particularly in faster-growing individuals [4](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis.pdf).

- **Advanced Stages:** Pronounced physical symptoms such as abdominal swelling, hemorrhages, and darkened skin, leading to high mortality rates of 10% to 90% [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis-ipn)[4](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis.pdf).

- **Impact on Fish Health:** IPN severely compromises immune function and overall vitality, making fish susceptible to secondary infections [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32033004/).

### Causes of Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis

**Etiology**

- **Causative Agent:** Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus (IPNV), an Aquabirnavirus [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis-ipn)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_pancreatic_necrosis).

- **Transmission Methods:**
    - **Horizontal Transmission:** Spread through infected water and equipment [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis-ipn).
    - **Vertical Transmission:** From parent to progeny through infected eggs [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis-ipn).


**Risk Factors**

- **Environmental Factors:** Outbreaks can occur at water temperatures between 4°C and 18°C, with stress factors such as high stocking densities and fluctuations in water temperature and salinity increasing susceptibility [4](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis.pdf).

- **Farm Management Practices:** Movement of equipment from infected sites and improper handling of mortalities and wastes can facilitate the spread of the virus [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis-ipn).

### Diagnosis

**Diagnostic Methods**

- **Clinical Examination:** Observation of physical and behavioral symptoms [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis-ipn)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_pancreatic_necrosis).

- **Laboratory Tests:**
    - **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction):** Detects IPNV genetic material in fish tissues [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32033004/).
    - **Virus Isolation:** Culturing the virus in tissue culture [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis-ipn).
    - **ELISA and Antibody Neutralization:** For identification of the virus [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis-ipn).


**Differential Diagnosis**

- **Distinguishing IPN from Other Diseases:** It is crucial to differentiate IPN from diseases with similar symptoms, such as infectious salmon anaemia (ISA), infection with salmonid alphavirus (SAV), infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN), and viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) [4](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis.pdf).

### Treatment and Prevention

**Treatment Options**

- **Current Treatments:** There are no specific antiviral treatments for IPN. Management focuses on preventing the spread and mitigating the impact through biosecurity measures [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis-ipn)[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32033004/).

**Preventive Measures**

- **Biosecurity Protocols:**
    - Testing of broodstock and destruction of eggs from infected parents [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis-ipn).
    - Avoiding movement of equipment from infected sites [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis-ipn).

- **Vaccination Strategies:** A provisional marketing authorization has been granted for a vaccine against IPN [1](https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/infectious-pancreatic-necrosis-ipn).

- **Farm Management Practices:**
    - Maintaining high water quality and low stocking density [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_pancreatic_necrosis).
    - Implementing strict protocols regarding movement, water sources, and stock replacement [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_pancreatic_necrosis).
